So I took some time and updated the upcoming releases on the right.  You might notice less DVD''s than normal.  That is not due to a lack of upcoming releases, but less of the releases actually interest me.  Also, I have been more interested in manga as of late.  So I might <i>try</i> to start putting more manga on the site.',1);

It seems my ip changed and the files that were linked to it were not available.  I have returned to using the onsite versions of the files so the site should look ok.  I am sorry for those that have had trouble viewing the site these past few weeks.  It seems that more and more people are coming to the site, and my bandwidth on Tripod is not sufficient.  Eventually I would like to fix this problem, but I am not in the situation to do so yet.',1);

Head judge Toshiaki Inamura explained, "After Studio Nue planned the project, the general director was engaged creatively in producing the series entirely. Tatsunoko made a contract with each staff member and managed the production." Japanese copyright law gives ownership to the company when the body of work is created by its employees (or by people under contract) as a part of their duties. Therefore, the property right are guaranteed to the production company, not the planner(s) nor the director(s).  In October 2002 the Tokyo district court ruled that the rights to the design of the Valkery belong to Studio Nue.',1);
