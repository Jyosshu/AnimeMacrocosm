Head judge Toshiaki Inamura explained, "After Studio Nue planned the project, the general director was engaged creatively in producing the series entirely. Tatsunoko made a contract with each staff member and managed the production." Japanese copyright law gives ownership to the company when the body of work is created by its employees (or by people under contract) as a part of their duties. Therefore, the property right are guaranteed to the production company, not the planner(s) nor the director(s).  In October 2002 the Tokyo district court ruled that the rights to the design of the Valkery belong to Studio Nue.',1);

I really didn''t think that Manga could get any worse, but they have gone and proven me wrong.
